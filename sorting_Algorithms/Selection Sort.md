Selection Sort is one of the **simplest sorting algorithms** in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).  
It is a **comparison-based, in-place sorting technique**.    
ðŸ‘‰ In simple words:
- It works by **repeatedly finding the smallest (or largest)** element from the **unsorted part** of the array and placing it in its **correct position** in the sorted part. 

So, the array gets divided into two parts:

1. **Sorted part** (at the left, grows step by step).
    
2. **Unsorted part** (at the right, shrinks step by step).
