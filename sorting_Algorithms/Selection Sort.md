Selection Sort is one of the **simplest sorting algorithms** in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).  
It is a **comparison-based, in-place sorting technique**.    
ðŸ‘‰ In simple words:
- It works by **repeatedly finding the smallest (or largest)** element from the **unsorted part** of the array and placing it in its **correct position** in the sorted part. 

So, the array gets divided into two parts:
1. **Sorted part** (at the left, adding step by step).
2. **Unsorted part** (at the right, reduced step by step).

## working of selection sort:

**Step - by - Step:** 
1. Start with the first element of the array.
2. Find the **minimum element** from the unsorted part.
3. Swap it with the **first element**.
4. Now the first element is sorted.
5. Repeat this process for the remaining elements until the array is sorted.
