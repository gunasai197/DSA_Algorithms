Insertion Sort is a **simple sorting algorithm** that builds the final sorted array one element at a time just like how we sort playing cards in our hands.

### How it Works (Logic)

1. Start from the **second element** (index `1`) because the first element alone is already “sorted”.
2. Pick the current element (called **key**) and compare it with elements before it.
3. Shift all elements that are **greater than the key** one position to the right.
4. Insert the key into its correct position.
5. Repeat until the whole array is sorted.
