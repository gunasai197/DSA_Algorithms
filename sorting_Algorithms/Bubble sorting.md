# what is bubble sorting:

- Bubble Sort is one of the simplest **sorting algorithms** in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.
- It works by **repeatedly swapping adjacent elements** if they are in the wrong order.
- This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity are quite high.
- Good for **small datasets** and for **learning sorting basics**.

## Working of Bubble Sort

1. Compare the **first two elements**.
    - If the first is greater than the second â†’ swap them.    
2. Move to the next pair (2nd and 3rd elements) â†’ compare and swap if needed.
3. Keep going until the **last element**.
    - After the first pass, the **largest element is at the end**.   
4. Repeat the process for the **remaining elements** until the list is sorted.

## Real World Examples using bubble sort:

   1 **Arranging students by height in a line**
- Suppose students are standing randomly.
- You keep checking each **pair of neighbors**:
    - If the left one is taller than the right one â†’ swap.   
- After one full round, the **tallest student goes to the end** (like the "largest bubble").

 2 **Sorting books on a shelf (small collection)**
    - If you only have a few books, you might check two books next to each other and swap them if theyâ€™re out of order.
    - After repeating, the heaviest/largest book keeps moving to the end.

 3 **Small-Scale Data Sorting**
- For example, if a **shopkeeper** has just 5â€“10 products and wants to sort prices quickly in a simple program, Bubble Sort works fine.
- Sorting **student marks** in a small classroom.


## code for bubble sort:
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        swapped = False   # assume no swaps this round
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
                swapped = True   # swap happened
        if not swapped:   # no swap = array already sorted
            break
    return arr

print(bubble_sort([2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))  # already sorted

```

## Time and space complexity for bubble sort:
# 1. Time Complexity

Time complexity measures **how many operations** (comparisons, swaps, etc.) the algorithm performs in terms of input size `n`.

ðŸ‘‰ **Steps to find it:**

1. **Look at loops** (for/while).
    - Each loop contributes to time complexity.
2. **Count operations inside loops.**
    - Comparisons, swaps, assignments.
3. **Multiply nested loops.**
    - Example: a loop inside a loop (`O(n) * O(n) = O(nÂ²)`).
4. **Take the dominant term** (ignore constants and lower-order terms).

**Example: Bubble Sort**
```
for i in range(n):                 # Loop 1 â†’ runs n times
    for j in range(0, n-i-1):      # Loop 2 â†’ runs (n-i-1) times
        if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:      # comparison â†’ O(1)
            swap(arr[j], arr[j+1]) # swap â†’ O(1)

```
- Outer loop â†’ **n times**
- Inner loop â†’ ~**n times** (on average)
- Total â†’ **n Ã— n = O(nÂ²)**
ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s how we say Bubble Sort takes **O(nÂ²)** in worst and average case.
	If no swaps (already sorted array) â†’ **O(n)** (best case).
# 2. Space Complexity

Space complexity measures **how much extra memory** the algorithm uses.

ðŸ‘‰ **Steps to find it:**
1. **Check extra variables.**
    - Integers, booleans â†’ O(1)
2. **Check extra arrays/structures.**
    - New array of size n â†’ O(n)
3. **Check recursion stack.**
    - Recursive calls may add extra space.

 **Example: Bubble Sort**
- Uses only:
    - `i`, `j` (loop variables) â†’ O(1)
    - `swapped` (boolean flag) â†’ O(1)
    - `temp` (for swapping) â†’ O(1)
- No extra arrays â†’ **O(1) space**
#  General Formula to find the time complexity

- If you see **one loop** â†’ O(n)
- **Two nested loops** â†’ O(nÂ²)
- **Three nested loops** â†’ O(nÂ³)
## Time Complexity:
- Best Case: **O(n)**
- Average Case: **O(nÂ²)** --> when data is **randomly ordered** like some elements are arrange in asc order, some are in desc orders
- Worst Case: **O(nÂ²)**
## Space Complexity
- Bubble Sort sorts **in-place** (no extra arrays needed).
- Only a few temporary variables (like `swapped` or `temp`).
ðŸ‘‰ Space Complexity = O(1)
