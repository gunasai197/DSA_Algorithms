## What is Merge sort:

**Merge sort Â is a popular sorting algorithm known for its efficiency and stability. 
It follows the divide-and-conquer** approach. It works by recursively dividing the input array into two halves, recursively sorting the two halves and finally merging them back together to obtain the sorted array.

## Here's a step-by-step explanation of how merge sort works:

> 1. **Divide:** Divide the list or array recursively into two halves until it can no more be divided.
> 2. **Conquer**: Each subarray is sorted individually using the merge sort algorithm.
> 3. **Merge:** The sorted subarrays are merged back together in sorted order. The process continues until all elements from both subarrays have been merged.
